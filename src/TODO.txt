- Add Dan's photo (google, prepare; add code to JS) that can be the following:

- - Health 33-1
- - Health 0
- - Recording
- - Editing
- - Sleeping
- ? Researched something
- ? Random event

- Style pop-ups (".eventPanel")
- Move the pop-ups somewhere from "div#wrapper"

- Find a place for "div#saveNotify"

- Progress bars for stuff like "Editing"
